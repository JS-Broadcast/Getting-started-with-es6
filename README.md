# Getting Started with ES6
* Repository containing some of the code examples from YouTube courses.


### 01. Getting started with ES6 - Environment 

In order to get started with ECMAScript 6, we need to have our Environment installed first. In this video course, we will use [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) which will compile our newly written ES6 into current ES5.

In order to proceed and install [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), we need to have [Node Package Manager](http://www.npmjs.com) installed. NPM comes with installing [nodejs](http://www.nodejs.org) so you can go ahead and [download](http://www.nodejs.org/download) the proper version for your operation system.
